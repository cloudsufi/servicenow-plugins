    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "BigQuery"
    And Configure BigQuery source plugin for Dataset and Table
    And Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
    And Capture the generated Output Schema
    And Close the Plugin Properties page
    And Select Sink plugin: "ServiceNow" from the plugins list
    And Connect plugins: "BigQuery" and "ServiceNow" to establish connection
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "ServiceNow"
    And Fill Reference Name
    And Select radio button plugin property: "operation" with value: "INSERT"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "tableName" and set the value to: "tableName"
